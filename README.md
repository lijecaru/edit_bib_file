# edit_bib_file
Simple routines to erase unused entries in a bib file (latex)

Warning: Not optimized! 

We need the tex file (our paper) and the bib file (where all our references are). We want to clean up the bib file because there may be a lot of references that we didn't end up using for our paper and we don't want that.
